  "author_bio": "Jesus Christ (c. 4 BC – c. AD 30/33) was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. According to the Gospels, Jesus taught primarily through parables—short, memorable stories that conveyed spiritual and moral truths. His teachings emphasized love, compassion, forgiveness, and the Kingdom of God. The parables collected here represent his most enduring and influential stories, which have been studied, interpreted, and cherished by billions of people across two millennia. These simple yet profound narratives continue to offer wisdom and guidance for readers of all faiths and backgrounds.",
